"""Streaming completion detection — Phase-1 appear loop + Phase-2 stream loop.

Phase 5 PR4 extraction (no behavior change). Owns the generation-completion
detection surface that was previously inlined in ``CDPDriver.send_and_stream``:

  - stall window constant (``PHASE_STALL_SECONDS``)
  - rate-limit pop-up phrase matchers (``_RATE_LIMIT_PHRASES``,
    ``is_rate_limited_text``)
  - Phase-1 appear loop: wait for a new assistant node, fail fast on a
    rate-limit pop-up, raise ``GenerationStuckError`` on a true stall
  - Phase-2 stream loop: poll the DOM for streamed text, yield deltas as
    ``StreamChunk``s, detect completion via the backend ``end_turn`` primary
    signal with the per-turn action button as a DOM fallback, raise
    ``GenerationStuckError`` on a three-signal stall

The driver-reference collaborator seam: ``CompletionDetector`` holds a
reference to its owning ``CDPDriver`` and reaches through it for the CDP
transport (``_js_strict``), the backend completion signals
(``_fetch_end_turn_for_turn`` / ``_get_live_conversation_id_best_effort``),
and the in-flight conversation id (``_current_conv_id``, read-only). No state
migrates into this module — it stays on the driver, and the detector is
stateless beyond ``_driver``.

Boundary: this module is the generation-completion detection layer.
``send_and_stream`` orchestration (pre-count, type/send, the post-loop
conversation-id resolve + ``_current_conv_id`` mutation, the
``_fetch_text_for_turn`` final reconcile, and the terminal
``finish_reason="stop"`` chunk) stays in ``cdp_driver.py``. The detector
yields **deltas only** — it never emits a
``finish_reason`` and never writes ``_current_conv_id``.

Per-call result surfacing: the driver's post-loop tail consumes two values the
Phase-2 loop accumulates as locals — ``last_dom_text`` (the streamed-text
baseline used to emit the ``_fetch_text_for_turn`` suffix delta) and
``had_non_text_content`` (drives the non-text placeholder). They cannot be
re-derived without re-running the poll, so after the generator exhausts the
driver reads ``self._completion.last_dom_text`` /
``self._completion.had_non_text_content``. These are transient per-call results
(reset at the start of each call), not long-lived configuration; the detector
holds no state across calls beyond ``_driver``.

Call-rule inside CompletionDetector method bodies — every internal call routes
through ``self._driver`` (NOT ``self``) to preserve monkeypatch interception on
the driver-facing seam (the PR2 lesson):

  transport:       self._driver._js_strict(...)
  backend signals: self._driver._fetch_end_turn_for_turn(...)
                   self._driver._get_live_conversation_id_best_effort(...)
  conv-id read:    self._driver._current_conv_id   (read once into a local;
                   NEVER assigned here)

Circular-import rule (mandatory): ``cdp_driver`` top-level re-exports
``PHASE_STALL_SECONDS`` and ``is_rate_limited_text`` from this module, so this
module must NOT import anything from ``cdp_driver`` at module load. The error
classes (``RateLimitError`` / ``GenerationStuckError``) and the ``StreamChunk``
yield type are imported **lazily inside ``stream_until_complete``**, after
``cdp_driver`` is fully initialized — mirroring the ``chatgpt_dom`` convention
(``chatgpt_dom.py`` lazy-imports ``CDPJSError``).

# A generation is considered "stuck" (vs. merely slow) if no DOM progress
# signal occurs within this window. Slow-but-progressing generations
# (image rendering, deep-research thinking) legitimately exceed this and
# are allowed the full timeout; a true stall fails fast here instead of
# hanging silently to the deadline. Applied to both Phase 1 (node appear)
# and Phase 2 (text streaming). 90s accommodates reasoning/thinking models,
# whose ``result-thinking`` placeholder can hold the DOM static for a minute+
# while the model reasons before the first answer token renders; the
# is_thinking reset covers the labeled phase, but there is an unlabeled gap
# between thinking-end and answer-start that also needs this headroom.
#
# P1 (2026-07-08): this constant is now the FALLBACK for phase_1_appear
# (unchanged behavior) and the default-class phase-2 budgets when no
# DetectorBudgets is resolved. Phase-2 detection has been refactored into a
# model-aware two-state machine (awaiting_first_content →
# streaming_after_first_content) with budgets from DetectorBudgets. See
# classify_model / DetectorBudgets below. Kept for back-compat (re-exported
# from cdp_driver; referenced by phase_1_appear which is deliberately
# unchanged).
PHASE_STALL_SECONDS = 90


# ── P1: model-aware detector budgets ─────────────────────────────────────
#
# Co-designed with ChatGPT (conversation 6a4ebc1e, 2026-07-08). The single
# PHASE_STALL_SECONDS=90 conflated two different states: "model hasn't
# produced visible text yet" (reasoning models think silently for 30-60s+)
# and "model was streaming text and then stopped" (a genuine hang). These
# should NOT share a stall budget. Reasoning models stress case 1; real
# network/UI hangs stress case 2.
#
# The fix: split phase-2 into first-content-wait vs stream-idle, with
# model-aware budgets on first-content specifically. DOM "thinking" signals
# are advisory liveness hints (generation_active_signal) within the hard
# cap — never authoritative clock-pauses.

# Slugs that indicate a reasoning-capable model. These models have a long
# silent "thinking" phase before the first answer token renders, which the
# old uniform 90s stall window falsely aborted. Matched case-insensitively
# against the slug via substring. "thinking" covers gpt-5-*-thinking and
# gpt-5-*-t-mini (Thinking Mini); "o1"/"o3"/"o4" are the o-series reasoning
# families; "research" is Deep Research; "reasoning" is a catch-all in case
# OpenAI introduces slugs that name it directly. Inclusive on purpose — a
# false negative (reasoning model gets the shorter default budget) is worse
# than a false positive (non-reasoning model gets the longer budget).
